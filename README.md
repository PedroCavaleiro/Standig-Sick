# Standing Sick

## Overview
This app was developped by me over a period of a month as a individual project for the course of Mobile Devices Programming
The objective of this app is to fill a questionaire when the user is in the waiting room of the urgencies.
One of the requested features of this app is to have a large font on the questionare and to be yes or no questions, adicionally can be left some extra observations (text field)

## Features
- Easy to fill the questionare (large fonts)

- The text file generated is accessible through the History page
- Ability to change the questions and answers of the questionaire
- Clear current questionare
- Settings page to change the Name, Email and password (the name and email will show on the report, the password is to access the questionare page)
